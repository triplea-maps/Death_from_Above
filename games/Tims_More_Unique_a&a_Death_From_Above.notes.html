A Classic version of a World War II game. 
			<br> By Tim H. Classic with some of the relative starting PUs, units, and att/def ratios tweaked. this version makes it less of a do or die game long "battle for karelia" than it seems to otherwise be and makes airpower cost effective without being overbearing. I welcome constructive criticism at thackenmiller@comcast.net
